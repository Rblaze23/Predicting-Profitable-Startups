    - City/Region: Choose from [Europe, USA, UK, India, Canada]. Choose the region based on company focus.
    - Description of the product: Use the companyâ€™s name and stage to generate a description.
    - Markets: Select appropriate markets based on company focus (SaaS, Fintech, Healthtech, AI, etc.).
    - Creation date: If available, set the creation date in the format "MM-YYYY". Set to present if not found.
    - Number of deals during the last 12 months: Use company characteristics to estimate deal flow.
    - Market value: Estimate based on the company's size, stage, and market.
    - Follow-on rate: For deals older than 18 months, calculate percentage based on investment stage.
    - Investments by stage: Provide investment breakdown by stage (seed, early, growth), given the company's stage.
